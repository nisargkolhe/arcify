## Features

- Vertical tab management
- Tab grouping functionality
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick access
- Bookmark integration
- Clean, minimal interface

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Google Chrome or Chromium-based browser
- Git (for version control)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nisargkolhe/arcify.git
   cd arcify
   npm install
   ```

2. **Development Build**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This creates a `dist-dev/` folder with source maps for debugging and watches for file changes.

3. **Production Build**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates an optimized `dist/` folder ready for distribution.

4. **Create Distribution Package**
   ```bash
   npm run build:zip
   ```
   This builds the extension and creates `arcify-extension.zip` for Chrome Web Store submission.

### Loading the Extension in Chrome

1. **Open Chrome Extensions page**
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Or go to Menu ‚Üí More Tools ‚Üí Extensions

2. **Enable Developer Mode**
   - Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top right corner

3. **Load the Extension**
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `dist/` or `dist-dev/` directory
   - The extension should now appear in your browser

### Development Workflow

1. **Make Changes**
   - Edit source files in the root directory
   - For development: `npm run dev` (watches for changes)
   - For production testing: `npm run build`

2. **Reload Extension**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click the refresh icon on the Arcify extension card
   - Or use Ctrl+R in the extension's popup/sidebar

3. **Debug**
   - Use Chrome DevTools for the extension pages
   - Check the extension's service worker in `chrome://extensions/`
   - View console logs in the extension's background page

### Build Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Development build with file watching
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run build:zip` - Build and create zip package
- `npm run zip` - Create zip from existing build
- `npm run clean` - Remove all build artifacts
- `npm run preview` - Preview the built extension
- `npm run info` - Display build information and status
- `npm run release <type>` - Create a new release (patch/minor/major/x.y.z)

### Release Process

The project uses automated releases via GitHub Actions. To create a new release:

1. **Prepare your changes**
   ```bash
   # Make sure all changes are committed
   git status
   ```

2. **Create a release**
   ```bash
   # For bug fixes (2.2.0 ‚Üí 2.2.1)
   npm run release patch
   
   # For new features (2.2.0 ‚Üí 2.3.0)
   npm run release minor
   
   # For breaking changes (2.2.0 ‚Üí 3.0.0)
   npm run release major
   
   # For specific version
   npm run release 2.5.0
   ```

3. **Automated process**
   - Updates `package.json` and `manifest.json` versions
   - Builds and tests the extension
   - Creates a git tag and pushes to GitHub
   - GitHub Actions automatically:
     - Builds the extension
     - Generates release notes from commits
     - Creates a GitHub release
     - Attaches the zip file and SHA256 checksum

4. **Monitor the release**
   - Check the [Actions tab](https://github.com/nisargkolhe/arcify/actions) for build status
   - Review the generated release at [Releases](https://github.com/nisargkolhe/arcify/releases)
